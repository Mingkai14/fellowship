Identifykey FastQC metrics to decide when to trim raw reads, identify when sequencing adapters need to be removed, and observe how trimming improces dataset quality.

- 00:00 Learning objectives
- 00:30 Standard tools for QC
- 00:49 Per base sequencing quality
- 01:52 Per sequence GC content
- 02:03 Overrepresented sequences
- 02:34 Trimming needed
- 02:46 Trimming strategy
- 04:04 Trimming successful
- 04:31 Assess - did the trimming work?
- 04:52 Acknowledgements
