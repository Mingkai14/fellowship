## My interests

I am interested in promoting a more inclusive research culture by embracing an open research approach in all of my work and advocating for this approach to others. Therefore, I want to enable other researchers to fill the skills gap that open research presents. This includes developing training in more sustainable data management such as using data management plans, planning for FAIR implementation and also the considerations needed for open data. I am particularly interested in how we can work with sensitive data to make it FAIR and also how we can build inclusive research communities to bring about more sustainable data sharing.

## My work

I am an active Open Researcher and I currently have two roles: I work at The Alan Turing Institute as a Research Associate. I work on a number of projects within the institute and my current focuses are as the Community Manager for the DECOVID project (A Covid-19 research project that strives to answer clinically important research questions using a multi-centre dataset of standardised electronic health records) and as a core contributor to The Turing Way project (a project to build a resource in the form of an online book to enable reproducible research). My second role is as the Principal Investigator of the FAIR Phytoliths project based at Historic England. This is a project that aims to implement the FAIR data principles by investigating existing data-sharing practices and also by building a community to help train and sustain this effort. This project is funded by EOSC-life and I work in collaboration with colleagues from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra and the Spanish National Research Council. I am also a Software Sustainability Fellow working to promote inclusive and sustainable research practices. This has involved working with other SSI Fellows to run workshops about reproducibility and training on specific tools used to implement open practices such as Github and Binder. I am a mentor for Open Life Science, which is a training and mentoring programme for open science leaders. I sit on a number of committees and boards such as the Association of Environmental Archaeology, International Phytolith Society and Peer Community In Archaeology.
