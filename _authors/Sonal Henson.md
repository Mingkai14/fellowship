## My interests

My interests are in genomics and how genomic data can be used to answer biological questions. Having spent most of my life in the Tropics, diseases that afflict the global South interest me in particular.

## My work

I am a Bioinformatician at the Deep Seq facility at Nottingham University. We offer researchers in life sciences access to high-throughput sequencing technologies. As a bioinformatician at Deep Seq, some of my roles are analysing and reporting genomic data generated through our platform for the platform users and managing all data generated and processed. Before joining Deep Seq, I was a researcher at the International Livestock Research Institute in Kenya. I was part of a team of scientists researching and developing vaccines for livestock diseases endemic to sub-Saharan Africa.
