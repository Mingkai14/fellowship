## My interests

My research and training interests lie in a wide range of biological and biomedical sciences fields, from comparative genomics and evolutionary studies to neuroscience research and personalised medicine. I am interested in developing and delivering material in several aspects of bioinformatics and biological data management. My teaching philosophy is the generation of an opportunity to inspire and empower, comprised of a combination of course instruction and student mentorship. I’m aiming at fostering the acquisition of a base of concepts and learning skills to facilitate a person to engage in further learning and independent thinking.

## My work

I am mainly focused on studying the molecular mechanism of neuropsychological disorders and brain tumours. I aim to investigate the molecular origins of diseases and develop novel methods for diagnosis and prognosis, such as designing more targeted treatment strategies. It involves methods originating from systems biology, NGS and “omics” technologies, large multi-dimensional data integration and interpretation, and clinical informatics. I am also the course leader of the MSc in Bioinformatics and the module leader of several modules at the MSc and BSc levels related to data analysis and data management. In my free time, I regularly organise and deliver bioinformatics and data analysis workshops at several Universities across the UK and other European countries.
