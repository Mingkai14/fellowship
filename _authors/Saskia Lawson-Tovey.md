## My interests

My interests are in electronic clinical data collection (in particular, REDCap) and data pseudonymisation and harmonisation. I am interested in improving training in database design and set-up, as well as data quality and harmonisation in clinical research, and increasing data management knowledge and understanding among colleagues who lack technical knowledge and data management experience. I plan to create some simple, easy-to-share resources to provide bite-sized information on how to use REDCap effectively.

## My work

I am a data scientist in the Centre for Musculoskeletal Research at the University of Manchester, working on the EULAR COVID-19 and COVAX registries, CLUSTER consortium and CAPTURE-JIA. My main interests are in electronic clinical data collection (in particular, REDCap) and data pseudonymisation and harmonisation (primarily clinical data). Making data management accessible for those who don’t have the technical knowledge and/or relevant experience is important to me; I hold a degree in languages and learnt database and data management skills during an internship, often on my own with little support as the resources didn’t exist.
