## My interests 

I am passionate about optimisation and high-performance computing for scientific software. My research interests originally started with complex systems research focusing on biological systems. Modelling biological systems through graph theory and cellular automata introduced me to scientific software development. 

## My work

I am the Research Software Engineer for CyVerse UK, the cloud computing infrastructure dedicated to life science research hosted by the Earlham Institute. My job is to maintain virtualisation and support new technologies, providing services to numerous UK life scientists.
