## My interests

I am interested in the management of imaging data, particularly light microscopy imaging. I am interested in training microscopists and biologists to make their images and the associated metadata FAIR.

## My work

I am part of the Computing and Advanced Microscopy Development Unit (CAMDU) in the Medical School at the University of Warwick. I am a Research Fellow and I support researchers with data management, analysis and computing tasks. I provide training to our users, in subjects such as image analysis and data management, and write custom software. I maintain servers hosting OMERO, a software for managing, visualizing and analyzing microscopy images, and Electronic Lab Notebooks which are used by researchers to record and manage their research data. My background is in mathematics and bioengineering, including image-based computer modelling.
