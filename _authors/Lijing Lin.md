## My interests

I am interested in all aspects of data and numerics. My research journey began as a PhD student in numerical analysis, followed by a three-year postdoctoral experience, focusing on developing theories, algorithms and software relating to numerical linear algebra. Then given an excellent opportunity to transition into biomedical sciences, my research has since mainly focused on applying statistical methods and machine learning techniques to biological and health problems.

## My work

My current role focuses on training and support. I am a Research Bioinformatician based in the Translation Manchester Team within the Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health at the University of Manchester. My work is to provide bioinformatics and health informatics support to researchers across the University/NHS/industrial partners. In addition, I manage the ‘Request Bioinformatics Expertise’ Service, where I provide solution/expert advice/training on areas such as NGS data analysis, multi-omics data integration, and how to leverage biological data from the public domain. I also maintain a GitHub repository collating free self-learning materials in bioinformatics.
