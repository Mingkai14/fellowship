## My interests

I am interested in developing interactive training in computational tools for conducting machine learning analyses with transcriptomics data.

## My work

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Cardiff University. I am working on computational methods for biomarker discovery in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, a disease affecting an estimated three million infants globally each year. Clinicians currently lack timely and accurate tests for sepsis, and transcriptomic biomarkers offer a promising solution. My work, part of Project Sepsis in Cardiff, involves the analysis of gene expression and clinical data from multiple patient cohorts from around the globe, using techniques spanning bioinformatics, statistics, and machine learning. A particular focus is the preparation of transcriptomics data and clinical metadata for machine learning applications and the development of robust and reusable pipelines to support this.
