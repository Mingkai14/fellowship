# ELIXIR-UK Fellowship
The ELIXIR-UK Fellowship aims to embed Research Data Management (RDM) know-how into UK universities and institutes. Data steward Fellows will create training materials and deliver local training. We look to support Fellows’ RDM training activities and efforts to build a community of practice within their host institutions. 


## Contribute
If you want to contribute to our training materials, we encourage you to apply to become an ELIXIR-UK Fellow when the next application round opens.

The ELIXIR Fellowship is part of a broader project with the ambitious goal of supporting the life sciences UK workforce in research data management and professionalising the role of Data Stewards.
