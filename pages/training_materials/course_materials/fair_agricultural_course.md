### Who is this lesson for?

This lesson is aimed at long-term agricultural experiment (LTE) managers, and researchers interested in using long-term agricultural experiment data, who want to apply FAIR principles and good research data management practices to their LTE data. While the target audience for this lesson is therefore LTE managers and researchers, the lesson covers many data management and FAIR data topics relevant to a broader audience working on agricultural field trials.
