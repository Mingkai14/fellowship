Submitting your data to a repository is a good way to make the data FAIR. This will make it:

Findable, as the data will be given specific identifiers
Accessible, as the data will be available online, open and free where possible
Interoperable, as the repository will often enforce the use of formalised, consistent language
Reusable, as the data will be released under a license with detailed provenance
